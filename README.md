abstract="Motif finding is the problem of identifying recurring patterns in sequences. It has been widely studied and several variants have been proposed. Here, we address the problem of finding common motifs with gaps that are present in all strings of a finite set. We prove that the problem is NP-hard by reducing the multiple longest common subsequence (MLCS) problem to it. We also provide a branch and bound algorithm for MLCS and show how the algorithm can be extended to give an algorithm for finding common motifs with gaps after common factors that occur in all the strings have been identified.",
